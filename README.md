# RL-Mario
A project with the deep learning course DV2586 regarding how one might use proximal policy optimization in order to train a deep reinforcement learning agents. The enviroment chosen for this this task is none other than the very first level of the classic video game Super Mario Bros. Describing the challenges one might face when tying to construct and train a video game playing reinforcement learning agent. Then finally taking a dive into the inner workings of reinforcement learning, environments and algorithms to solve the problems that the environments present.
